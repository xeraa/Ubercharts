/**
 * The actual series to be plotted on a chart.
 * <p/>
 * This interface is designed for convenient use through chaining. There are
 * five concrete Implementations which should cover all possible variations,
 * supported by Highcharts. Normally, you shouldn't need to implement this
 * interface by your own.
 * <p/>
 * For more information read href="http://www.highcharts.com/ref/#series.
